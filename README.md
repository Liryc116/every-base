# every-base

Trying to basic programs in multiple languages
For now the following languages are aimed:
    - C
    - C#
    - CPP
    - Python
    - a bit of Assembly (68k to begin maybe other later)


Some of the bases are (non-exhaustive list):
    - FizzBuzz
    - DigitCount
    - Factorial
    - Fibbonacci
    - IsPrime
    - SieveOfEratosthene
    - SumOfDivisor
    - SquareRoot
    - Power
    - PowerOfTwo
    - Swap
    - Strlen
    - ToLower
    - ToUpper
    - Str(n)Cat
    - CharHistogram
    - CountWords
    - ArrayRotation
    - IsSorted
    - MergeSorted
    - BinSearch
    - BubbleSort
    - QucikSort
    - Atoi
    - Atoui

The function will be optimized in the limit of my capacities
