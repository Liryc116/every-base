Trying to basic programs in multiple languages


Some of the bases are (non-exhaustive list):
    - FizzBuzz
    - DigitCount
    - Factorial
    - Fibbonacci
    - IsPrime
    - SumOfDivisor
    - SquareRoot
    - Power
    - PowerOfTwo
    - Swap
    - Strlen
    - IsSorted
    - BinSearch
    - BubbleSort
    - QucikSort
    - Atoi
    - Atoui

The function will be optimized in the limit of my capacities
